			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>
The purpose of this website is to help users discover easy, quick, and affordable recipes they can make at home. It aims to simplify the cooking experience for people who may not have much time, experience, or access to expensive ingredients.
</p>

<p>
By providing a searchable collection of simple meals with short descriptions and tags, the site encourages users to cook more confidently and make healthier food choices. The recipe book is designed to be responsive, easy to navigate, and fun to use.

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>The primary audience for this website includes college students, beginner cooks, and busy individuals who want to prepare simple, healthy, and affordable meals. These users often have limited time, cooking experience, or budget, so the site is designed to make it easy for them to find quick and practical recipes.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>
JavaScript will be used to make the website interactive and dynamic. Recipes will be stored in an array of objects, and JavaScript will dynamically render recipe cards on the page using <code>forEach()</code>. Users will be able to search recipes using keywords, and JavaScript will filter the array in real time to display only matching results using <code>filter()</code>.
</p>

<p>
A "Random Recipe" button will be implemented to select and display a single recipe at random from the array using JavaScript's <code>Math.random()</code> function. Event listeners will detect user input in the search field and button clicks, and update the DOM accordingly. The site will also demonstrate conditional logic (e.g., checking if search results exist or are empty) and will show or hide elements based on user interaction.
</p>
