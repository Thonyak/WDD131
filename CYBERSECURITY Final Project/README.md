# üîê Password Strength & Honeypot Trap Demo 

## üéì Final Cybersecurity Project ‚Äì README

This project simulates a secure login environment with enhanced defenses and an intentional honeypot trap to demonstrate how attackers can be tracked after repeated login failures. It's designed for **educational use only** to teach ethical hacking defense strategies and login hardening techniques.

| ‚úÖ Password Strength Meter       | Visual meter showing strength based on characters, digits, symbols, etc.   |
| üß† Attack Resistance Scoreboard | Displays how vulnerable the password is to various attack types            |
| üö´ Login Lockout System          | After 3 failed login attempts, login is disabled                            |
| üîê CAPTCHA Verification          | Shown after 3 failed attempts to simulate bot protection                    |
| ‚úÖ 2FA Simulation                | Users must enter a 6-digit code after successful credentials                |
| üéØ Brute-Force Attack Demo       | Runs a dictionary attack simulation on a known password list               |
| ü™§ Trap Page (`trap.html`)       | Fake recovery login page to simulate attacker tracking                     |
| üìÑ Trap Logs Viewer              | `trap-logs.html` displays all attacker attempts from the trap page         |

## üß™ Instructor Testing Instructions

To test the full system:

1. Open `index.html`
2. Enter incorrect credentials (anything except `admin` / `Admin@123`) **3 times**
3. Click the red **‚Äúrecovery link‚Äù**
4. You'll land on `trap.html` (the honeypot)
5. Enter any fake username and password
6. A warning will appear: ‚Äú‚ö†Ô∏è You are being tracked. Activity logged.‚Äù
7. Open `trap-logs.html` in the same browser to view the logged attempt

> üí° **Note:** To view the trap logs, please open `trap-logs.html` after interacting with the trap page. The logs are stored in `localStorage`, so testing must be done in the **same browser session**.

## ‚úÖ Default Login Credentials

- **Username:** `admin`  
- **Password:** `Admin@123`  
- This combination will trigger the **2FA simulation**.
